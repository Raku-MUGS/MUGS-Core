     # 80% of accessibility is good universal design that works for everyone;
     # this is about enabling the last 20% of tuning that requires tradeoffs.
     # It is especially important for UIs that do not have intrinsic semantic
     # richness; for example, raw VT100 terminal output has fewer options for
     # integrating rich semantic information that assistive technologies can
     # leverage than HTML5 does.
